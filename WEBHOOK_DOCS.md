# Vehicle Webhook API Documentation

## Overview

The webhook endpoint allows third-party services (Zoho CRM, inventory systems, etc.) to create and update vehicles using a simple upsert pattern driven by **`crmid`** (CRM ID).

**Base URL:** `https://car-template-demo.vercel.app`  
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/webhooks/vehicles`

---

## Key Concept: UPSERT by CRM ID

Instead of separate "create" and "update" actions, the webhook uses a single **upsert** pattern:

- **If `crmid` doesn't exist** → Creates a new vehicle
- **If `crmid` exists** → Updates the existing vehicle
- **Multiple vehicles can have the same name/slug** (e.g., multiple "Tesla Model 3" in different colors)
- **`crmid` must be unique** (it's your unique identifier from your CRM system)

This means you can send the same webhook call multiple times with the same `crmid`, and it will always update the existing vehicle instead of creating duplicates!

## Complete Examples

### Example 1: Create New Vehicle with Images

```bash
curl -X POST "https://car-template-demo.vercel.app/api/webhooks/vehicles" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "crmid": "ZOHO-DEAL-98765",
    "data": {
      "slug": "bmw-x5-white-2024",
      "title": "BMW X5 2024 - White",
      "brand": "BMW",
      "model": "X5",
      "year": 2024,
      "price": 95000,
      "is_published": true,
      "km": 500,
      "gear_type": "Automatic",
      "fuel_type": "Hybrid",
      "main_image_url": "https://images.example.com/bmw-x5-main.jpg",
      "short_description": "Premium BMW X5 SUV with hybrid engine"
    },
    "images": [
      {
        "image_url": "https://images.example.com/bmw-x5-front.jpg",
        "position": 1,
        "alt_text": "Front view"
      },
      {
        "image_url": "https://images.example.com/bmw-x5-side.jpg",
        "position": 2,
        "alt_text": "Side view"
      },
      {
        "image_url": "https://images.example.com/bmw-x5-interior.jpg",
        "position": 3,
        "alt_text": "Interior"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

### Example 2: Update Existing Vehicle (Same CRMID)

Send the exact same call with updated values:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://car-template-demo.vercel.app/api/webhooks/vehicles" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "crmid": "ZOHO-DEAL-98765",
    "data": {
      "slug": "bmw-x5-white-2024",
      "title": "BMW X5 2024 - White",
      "brand": "BMW",
      "model": "X5",
      "year": 2024,
      "price": 92000,
      "is_published": true,
      "km": 1500,
      "gear_type": "Automatic",
      "fuel_type": "Hybrid",
      "main_image_url": "https://images.example.com/bmw-x5-main.jpg",
      "short_description": "Premium BMW X5 SUV with hybrid engine - Updated price"
    }
  }'
```

The webhook will automatically update the vehicle because the `crmid` already exists. No need to track vehicle IDs!

### Example 3: Add More Images to Existing Vehicle

```bash
curl -X POST "https://car-template-demo.vercel.app/api/webhooks/vehicles" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "crmid": "ZOHO-DEAL-98765",
    "data": {
      "slug": "bmw-x5-white-2024",
      "title": "BMW X5 2024 - White",
      "brand": "BMW",
      "model": "X5",
      "year": 2024,
      "price": 92000,
      "is_published": true
    },
    "images": [
      {
        "image_url": "https://images.example.com/bmw-x5-rear.jpg",
        "position": 4,
        "alt_text": "Rear view"
      },
      {
        "image_url": "https://images.example.com/bmw-x5-dashboard.jpg",
        "position": 5,
        "alt_text": "Dashboard"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

## Important Notes

### ⚠️ Slug is NOT Unique

The `slug` field does NOT need to be unique. You can have multiple vehicles with the same slug:
- Multiple "Tesla Model 3" (different colors, years, etc.)
- Multiple "Honda Civic" (different trims, body colors, etc.)

The **`crmid` is what makes each vehicle unique**.

### ⚠️ Image URLs Must Be HTTPS

- ✅ Supported: `https://images.example.com/car.jpg`
- ✅ Supported: `https://drive.google.com/uc?id=FILE_ID&export=view` (Google Drive)
- ✅ Supported: `https://drive.google.com/uc?id=FILE_ID&export=download` (Google Drive direct download)
- ❌ Not supported: `data:image/jpeg;base64,...` (base64 images)
- ❌ Not supported: `http://...` (non-HTTPS)

**Note:** Google Drive URLs are automatically converted to direct download format. You can use either the view or download format - the system will handle it correctly.

### 📸 Image Storage

Images are automatically downloaded from the provided URLs and stored in **Supabase Storage**:
- **Bucket:** `vehicle-images`
- **Folder Structure:** `vehicles/{slug}-{idSuffix}/` (e.g., `vehicles/honda-civic-2024-097dc71b/`)
- **Filename Format:** `{position}-{timestamp}.{ext}` (e.g., `1-1704865200000.jpg`)
- **Access:** Public URLs are automatically generated and stored in the database
- **Automatic:** No additional configuration needed - images are downloaded and uploaded automatically

### ✅ Safe to Resend

You can safely resend the same webhook call multiple times with the same `crmid`:
- First call → Creates vehicle
- Second call → Updates vehicle (not duplicate!)
- Third call → Updates vehicle again
- etc.

This is perfect for automated sync processes where you might call the webhook periodically.

### Image Positions

- Position 1: Primary/main image (displayed prominently)
- Positions 2-10: Secondary images (shown in gallery/thumbnails)

---

## Database Setup

Before using the webhook, ensure you have:

1. **Remove UNIQUE constraint from slug**:
```sql
ALTER TABLE vehicles DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS vehicles_slug_key;
```

2. **Ensure crmid is UNIQUE**:
```sql
ALTER TABLE vehicles ADD CONSTRAINT vehicles_crmid_unique UNIQUE (crmid);
```

3. **Create the vehicle_images table**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS vehicle_images (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  vehicle_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES vehicles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  image_url TEXT NOT NULL,
  position INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (position >= 1 AND position <= 10),
  alt_text TEXT,
  uploaded_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE (vehicle_id, position)
);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_vehicle_images_vehicle_id ON vehicle_images(vehicle_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_vehicle_images_position ON vehicle_images(vehicle_id, position);
```

## Integration Examples

### Zoho CRM Workflow

1. Set up a Zoho Flow that triggers when a Deal is created/updated
2. Send webhook to: `https://car-template-demo.vercel.app/api/webhooks/vehicles`
3. Map Deal fields:
   - `Deal ID` → `crmid`
   - `Deal Name` → `title`
   - `Car Brand` (custom field) → `brand`
   - `Car Model` (custom field) → `model`
   - etc.

### Custom Integration

Any system that can make HTTP POST requests can trigger the webhook:

```javascript
// JavaScript/Node.js Example
const response = await fetch('https://car-template-demo.vercel.app/api/webhooks/vehicles', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    crmid: 'YOUR-CRM-ID',
    data: {
      slug: 'your-car-slug',
      title: 'Your Car Title',
      brand: 'Brand',
      model: 'Model',
      year: 2024,
      price: 50000,
      is_published: true
    }
  })
});

const result = await response.json();
console.log(result);
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "duplicate key value violates unique constraint"

**Cause:** You're using a `crmid` that already exists and trying to upsert, or the database constraint is incorrect.  
**Solution:** 
- Make sure you're using the correct unique identifier for your vehicle
- Ensure your database has the correct constraints set up

### Error: "Missing required fields: slug, title, ..."

**Cause:** You didn't include all required fields.  
**Solution:** Make sure your webhook includes all required fields in the `data` object.

### Images Not Appearing

**Cause:** Image URLs might be incorrect or not HTTPS.  
**Solution:** 
- Verify URLs are HTTPS (not HTTP)
- Verify URLs are accessible/public
- Check the server logs for warnings about skipped images

## Vehicle Deletion API

### Mark Vehicle as Sold (Soft Delete) - Recommended ✅

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/webhooks/vehicles/mark-sold`

Mark a vehicle as sold (sets `is_published = false`). The vehicle will be hidden from listings immediately and automatically deleted after 2 days.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "crmid": "ZOHO-DEAL-12345"
}
```

**Success Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Vehicle marked as sold",
  "crmid": "ZOHO-DEAL-12345",
  "note": "Vehicle will be automatically deleted after 2 days"
}
```

**Error Response (Not Found):**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "No vehicle found with crmid: ZOHO-DEAL-12345"
}
```

**Use Cases:**
- ✅ Vehicle was sold
- ✅ Want to keep history for 2 days
- ✅ Can be reversed by re-publishing
- ✅ Recommended for most cases

---

### Delete Vehicle Permanently (Hard Delete) ⚠️

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/webhooks/vehicles/delete` or `DELETE /api/webhooks/vehicles/delete`

Permanently delete a vehicle and all its images. **Cannot be undone!**

**Request (by CRM ID):**
```json
{
  "crmid": "ZOHO-DEAL-12345"
}
```

**Request (by Vehicle ID):**
```json
{
  "vehicleId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
}
```

**Success Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Vehicle deleted successfully",
  "crmid": "ZOHO-DEAL-12345"
}
```

**Error Response (Not Found):**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "No vehicle found with crmid: ZOHO-DEAL-12345"
}
```

**Use Cases:**
- ⚠️ Vehicle entered by mistake
- ⚠️ Duplicate vehicle
- ⚠️ Immediate removal needed
- ⚠️ **Warning:** Cannot be undone!

### Comparison: Soft Delete vs Hard Delete

| Feature | Soft Delete | Hard Delete |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **Speed** | Immediate | Immediate |
| **Reversible** | ✅ Yes (within 2 days) | ❌ No |
| **Keeps History** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Best For** | Sold vehicles | Mistakes/duplicates |
| **Endpoint** | `/mark-sold` | `/delete` |

**Recommendation:** Always use soft delete unless you have a specific reason for hard delete.
